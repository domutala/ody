# **What is Ody**

**Ody** is an ultra-fast and strongly typed data validator. It is built on a **sequential and immutable pipeline** of rules (validators and transformers).

## **Key Features**

* **Declarative and predictable validation**: with a clear separation between validation and transformation.
* **Optional and nullable values handling**: extensible and flexible.
* **Strictly ordered execution**: each node is applied in the defined sequence.
* **Strongly typed TypeScript support**: types are generated automatically.
* **Node.js and browser compatible**: works without any external dependencies.
