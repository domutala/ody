## What is Ody ?

**Ody** is an ultra-fast and strongly typed data validator for Node.js and browsers.  
It is built on a **sequential and immutable pipeline** of rules (validators and transformers), ensuring predictable validation, safe transformations, and fully inferred TypeScript types.

```ts[Basic usage]
import * as o from "ody";

const username = o.string()
  .min(3, "Username must contain at least 3 characters")
  .trim()
  .toLowerCase();

const result = username.parse("  Alice ");
console.log(result); // "alice"
```
