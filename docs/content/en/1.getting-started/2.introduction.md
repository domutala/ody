## What is Ody ?

**Ody** is an ultra-fast and strongly typed data validator for Node.js and browsers.  
It is built on a **sequential and immutable pipeline** of rules (validators and transformers), ensuring predictable validation, safe transformations, and fully inferred TypeScript types.

## Basic usage

```ts[index.ts]
import * as o from "ody";

const username = o.string()
  .min(3, "Username must contain at least 3 characters")
  .trim()
  .toLowerCase();

const result = username.parse("  Alice ");
console.log(result); // "alice"
```
  
## Key Features

- **Sequential & immutable pipeline**: deterministic and predictable validation flow.
- **Zero dependencies**: works in Node.js and browsers without extra packages.
- **Strong TypeScript inference**: types generated directly from your schema.
- **Validators & transformers**: clean separation of concerns.
- **Extensible architecture**: easily build custom validators or schema types.
- **Fast & lightweight**: optimized for server and client environments.

## Installation

::code-group

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add ody
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add ody
```

```bash [npm]
npm install ody
```

```bash [bun]
bun add ody
```

## Recommendation

If you are using TypeScript, we recommend that you enable strict mode in your tsconfig.json so that all types are calculated correctly.

```json [tsconfig.json]
{
  // ...
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ...
    "strict": true
  }
}
```
